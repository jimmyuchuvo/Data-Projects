# HR_EMPLOYEE_REPORT-SQL_POWERBI

This project involves analyzing employee data using SQL and Power BI, based on a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle. The process includes uploading the data to SQL Server, performing transformations with SQL scripts, and extracting the necessary information. Finally, all the files are loaded into Power BI for visualization.

## Project Description

The project starts with a CSV file sourced from Kaggle, which contains employee data. We upload this file to SQL Server where we execute SQL scripts to transform the data as required. The transformed data is then extracted into files, which are subsequently imported into Power BI for further analysis and visualization.

## Tools Used

- **SQL Server**: For data storage and transformation.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and reporting.
- **CSV File**: Source of the employee data downloaded from Kaggle.

## Data Transformation

1. **Upload CSV to SQL Server**: The CSV file data is uploaded to a SQL Server database.
2. **Transform Data**: SQL scripts are executed to perform necessary transformations.
3. **Extract Information**: Extracted data is saved into files for reporting.

## Visualization

All extracted files are loaded into Power BI for visualization. Various reports and dashboards are created to present the insights from the employee data.
